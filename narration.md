There's a lot of uncertainty ahead of us. Sometimes we fill these uncertainties with anxiety, worry, and hopelessness. I do the same because -- like yours -- it is my default setting.

But I make the conscious effort to fill uncertainty with level-headed thinking. Things can be harder or easier in the next couple of weeks. The only thing we know for sure is everyday brings us closer to the end of this pandemic.

When I try to climb a route, I break it down into sections. So instead of trying to overcome something big, I am approaching one small bit at a time.

I get sad. I worry. I am not in my home country and I don't know when the next flight will be. 

But I take it day by day. Sometimes, it's hard to get through a day. So I take it minute by minute. And sometimes, as I learned in yoga, we'll have to take it breath by breath.
