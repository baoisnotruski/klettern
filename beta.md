Here I a grab a hold with my left palm facing upward. We call this an `undercling`. 
My right hand is on a big hold. A hold that you can put most of your finger length behind is called a `jug`. 
#### 08

#### 15
Next, I aim for a hole in the wall we call a `pocket`.Since the pocket is farther than my left shoulder and I am reaching for it with my right hand, there is a natural tendency for my right hip to spin away from the wall. However, I try keep my hips relatively parallel to the rock so that my right foot remains engaged.
#### 15

#### 17 
As I reach for the next hold, I create a diagonal line of tension between my left foot and right hand. This tension keeps my right foot where it is to maintain three points of contact and prevent excess movement.

Smaller and slopier holds are less forgiving to excess movement. Imagine walking on mud (or ice or wet floor). If there's too much excess motion, you'll slip.

#### 17 

 
#### 20
With my left hand, I hold a slopey `sidepull`. Because there's not much to wrap my fingers around, I need maintain tension between my four fingers and thumb. 

To get ready to transfer most of my weight on my left hand, I switch the position of my feet. 
#### 20

#### 21
Otherwise, my body open up like a door and I pop away from the wall. We call this a `barn door`. (Although I find the German term more descriptive: it's called `die Offene Tuer` or the open door.)
#### 21

#### 30
In this sequence, I push down with my right foot like stepping on a gas pedal so that I can bring my body weight above my right foot. This position sets me up to bring my left foot to a foothold and create a wide stance. My feet push towards my hips to create a tension that supports my body weight.
#### 30

#### 35
Normally, I would clip with the hand closest to the quickdraw. This means that if the quickdraw is to my left, I clip with my left hand. However, in this case, I clipped a left-hand side quickdraw with my right hand because it allows me to maintain constant weight on both of my feet. This is called a `cross clip`.
#### 35

#### 41
This move I am not so sure exactly why I did it. Reaching with my left hand my have been simpler in terms of motor movement. But that may require shoulder strength that I don't have. 
#### 41

Next, my left foot slipped because I was panicking and placed it poorly. And that's okay. There are no mistakes, only happy accidents. 

#### 49
Here, I keep my right knee bent to maintain a claw-like action with my right foot. It's possible to tip-toe on reachy holds if you're climbing on rock that is 90 degrees or less. But this rock is overhanging. You can tell with the quickdraw above me -- how far it is from the rock.
#### 49

### 52
For my right hand, I grabbed a small hold that we call a `crimp`. For those of you have who have beastmakers back home, this hold will be fami liar to you because it feels similar to the top crimp of the beastmaker 1000.

Here, my elbows start to open up because my forearms are starting to swell from all the blood coming in. We call swollen and stiff forearms `pumped`. 

My body is telling me to stop supporting my hands with my forearm muscles. It wants to put all the weight directly to my shoulder blades so it forces my elbows open. This wide-elbowed stance is called `chicken wing`.  
### 52

### 59
Climbing with the wings of a chicken is not a good idea because it prevents you from loading a hold in the right direction. 
### 59

The next move is not reachy at all but the holds I am on were too small for me. So instead of making one reach with my left hand, I bring my right hand to where my left hand was. I do an outward kick of my right foot to channel excess swing. 


I then slide my left hips above my left foot to bring much as body weight above my left foot as possible.

I switch feet to kill the barn door. To do the switch, I put my right toes on top of my left toes; and drop my right foot as I move my left foot out of the way. Some people call this `foot switch`.

When I do this movement I remember Josh from Cebu City because he taught me this in the gym five or six years ago.

Next, bring my left foot out to keep my torso stable. It's not really stepping on anything. It is just there block the outward spin. This is called `flagging`.

Then I clip.
